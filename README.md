I plan to create a simple personal blog to share my ideas and thoughts. I'll use Hugo as the static site generator and host it on GitHub Pages. While I'm not a professional developer, I've had experience with programming. I learned C/C++ in school and Python at work, and I'm currently exploring Rust in my free time. I've been a Linux user for over 18 years, and Fedora is my current distribution of choice. I use Fedora because it's relatively straightforward and doesn't require a significant time commitment. 


## What do I do then? 
By day, I'm a renewable energy consultant specializing in solar power for commercial projects. That means I crunch data remotely from solar sites to see how they're doing. Lately, I've been diving into the world of software and DevOps, helping build solar analytics software. This got me familiar with some new tools like AWS, Postgres, Airflow, Jenkins, and Kubernetes, to name a few.


## What else do I do?
Beyond my role as a renewable energy consultant, I also have a few side ventures. I run a small export business and a small travel agency with the help of my friends and family.

## How old am I?

As of July 2024, I am 36.

## Aim of the blog

I created this blog to share my experiences, both successes and failures, with the hope of inspiring and educating others. By documenting my journey, I aim to provide valuable insights and lessons learned.
